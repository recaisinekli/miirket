Miirket server runs on miirket.com and waits for a miirket client to connect. If you have a free account a random port is reserved for the client temporarily. Two random but fixed ports are reserved for the BASIC account. The number of reserved ports are 7 for the PRO account.

You are free to use/modify the source code to host it on your own server.
