# What is miirket?
Miirket is an open source highly gifted socket. It creates a secure tunnel to let you access your Raspberry Pi over SSH without the need of IP address and port forwarding.

# Why do I need miirket?
You may have distributed linux devices. You may be using devices like Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi for various IOT applications. Miirket enables you to have SSH access to these devices and simplfy your management in an easy way. Moreover, you do not have to deal with static IP and port forwarding for this purpose.

# How it works?

Miirket server runs on miirket.com and waits for a miirket client to connect. If you have a free account a random port is reserved for the client temporarily. Two random but fixed ports are reserved for the BASIC account. The number of reserved ports are 7 for the PRO account.

You are free to use/modify the source code to host it on your own server.
